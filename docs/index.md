# VBGS-SLAM: Mathematical Derivations

This site (separate from the codebase) hosts the math for **Variational Bayesian Gaussian Splatting SLAM**.

- Generative model over spatial + color components
- Pose model on SE(3) with Lie-algebra linearization
- ELBO, responsibilities, and closed-form updates
- Birth/split/prune rules with Deltaâ€“Mixture coupling
- Practical notes matching our conventions (x forward, y left)

ðŸ‘‰ Code lives here: **[vbgs-slam](https://github.com/<your-username>/vbgs-slam)**.
